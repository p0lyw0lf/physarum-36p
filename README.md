Some kind of simplified openFrameworks implementation of [36 Points](www.sagejenson.com/36points/).

(Quite minimal non-interactive version of [Interactive physarum](https://github.com/Bleuje/interactive-physarum) project.)

Use arrow keys to switch between points.

Work derived from 36 Points (www.sagejenson.com/36points/) by Sage Jenson (mxsage) but with a different implementation.
This project is using counters on pixels and this is different.
It's using the set of parameters from 36 Points, some points work well, some don't, I had to tune stuff and kept what worked.

Simplified openFrameworks implementation of [36 Points](www.sagejenson.com/36points/), forked from [Bleuje's implementation](https://github.com/Bleuje/physarum-36p)

Use arrow keys to switch between pre-configured points.

Use q/a (lowercase) to change SA0, w/s to change SAA, e/d to change SAE, etc. Use z, x, and c respectively to toggle the amount you change SA0, SAA, and SAE by, similar pattern for the rest. When you run out of space on the keyboard, go back to the beginning with uppercase keys; that is, Q/A (uppercase) to change MD0, Z (uppercase) to toggle the amount.

Implementation derived from Bleuje (https://github.com/Bleuje/physarum-36p). This project is using counters on pixels and thus is different than the original 36 Points work.
It's using the same set of parameters, some points work well, some don't, had to tune stuff and kept what worked.
